# LPC2148-ADC-and-GPIO-Based-LED-Control
his project demonstrates Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) and GPIO control on the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller. The program reads an analog signal using the on-chip ADC (AD0.1 on P0.28) and visualizes its digital value through LEDs connected to GPIO pins P0.0â€“P0.9.
